You are a senior DevOps architect and backend performance engineer.

I am building a PHP-based web application that will be used by 3000–4000 students. 
I need you to design a complete automation and infrastructure setup to prevent crashes under concurrent usage.

Project Context:
- Backend: PHP (core PHP or Laravel)
- Database: MySQL
- Hosting: VPS (Linux)
- Expected peak users: 500–1200 simultaneous active users
- Features: login system, dashboard, CRUD operations, possible exam/result time traffic spikes

Your Task:

1. Design a production-ready server architecture.
2. Recommend:
   - Web server (Apache vs Nginx)
   - PHP-FPM configuration
   - MySQL optimization settings
   - Redis caching strategy
   - Load balancing (if needed)
3. Provide automation scripts for:
   - Server provisioning
   - Nginx + PHP setup
   - MySQL tuning
   - Enabling OPcache
   - Gzip & static caching
4. Provide load testing plan:
   - Tools to simulate 200–500 concurrent users
   - Example test scripts
5. Add monitoring & crash prevention:
   - Log monitoring
   - CPU & RAM monitoring
   - Auto-restart strategy
6. Add security hardening:
   - Rate limiting
   - Fail2ban
   - Firewall setup
   - Basic DDoS mitigation
7. Provide recommended VPS specs for:
   - Small load
   - Medium load
   - Exam-time heavy load

Output format:
- Clear architecture diagram (text format)
- Configuration file examples
- Bash automation scripts
- Performance tuning values
- Final checklist before production launch

Important:
Assume I am deploying on Ubuntu 22.04.
Focus on stability and concurrency safety.
Avoid overengineering unless truly needed.
Keep solution cost-effective.
